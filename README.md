An exciting aspect of modern machine learning techniques is their ability to uncover patterns in data that are both difficult for humans to notice or were previously unknown. In this paper, we attempt to use modern machine learning techniques to discover if dolphins species can be categorized by their vocalizations: a task that to our knowledge has not been attempted by humans or computer algorithms. We explore convolutional neural networks architectures as models for processing dolphin sound clips and categorizing them into four different species.

This repository contains notebooks for:
* 2D Convolutional Network on "Best of Cuts" data for four species of dolphins
* 2D Convolutional Network on "All Cuts" data for four species of dolphins
* 1D Convolutional Network on walrus and dolphins
* 2D Convolutional Network on walrus and dolphins
* Helper files for generating files
* Visualization notebooks for intput data and filters learnt by the Convolutional Networks
